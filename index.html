															<b>[The end of an era.]</b>



<b>  
															Dear who ever is reading this.
	=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
	
	
	I have enjoyed the last few years of my life and I wouldnt change any of it at all, you guys showed me what it was like to be a human, and yes at times I fucked up and treated people like they where lesser than they are.
	Due to recent events, I have realised that I need to change, not just how I treat people and act towards people but how I live and how I feel in my head, I have been lying to my self and others about my mental alot and,
	I need change in my life, over the next few months I am going to be working on my self and getting a job and working out, yknow shit like that. Ive come to hate who I have become and I cannot carry on how I have been
	for the last 5 years. Im a toxic person who only cares about them self and no one else, I laugh at others who are in worse situations than me and I poke fun at those who arent as fortunate as me.
	So Im taking matters in my own hands and growing up, for those who are worried about me, dont worry at all, Im not dissapearing for ever and I will be back soon, but not as Med, as a diffrent person, as a new man.
	Thank you to everyone who has been with me and stuck by my side no matter how I have treated you or my actions as a person, to those people I hold a very very special place in my heart for and I will never forget you.
	
											Until we meet again, this is a goodbye, thank you for the memories and the laughs.
